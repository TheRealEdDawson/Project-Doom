3,Man made,Industrial,Appin Mine Explosion,"On 24 July 1979 an explosion occurred in the underground mine in Appin, a small town situated 35 km north-west of Wollongong. The explosion was caused by a rush of methane gas in the K panel which was a remote area of the mine situated 3 km below the surface.  There were 45 individuals working in the mine at the time of the explosion. A total of 14 people lost their lives; 10 miners were killed in the crib room, while another four were killed in other areas of the mine.",1979,-34.19221115,150.78633120,0,0,0,14,$0.00,0,0,NSW,http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=3,"$42,000,000.00",$0.00
119,Man made,Industrial,Wonthaggi Gas Explosion,"On 15 February 1937, a powerful methane gas explosion occurred at the No 20 shaft, Dalyson Colliery, Wonthaggi.  The explosion was caused by the contact of a naked light and methane gas, and was propagated by coal dust. It was so powerful it catapulted a two ton iron cage 60 ft from the mouth of the shaft to the top of the poppet head.  Thirteen miners were killed in the explosion. The explosion resulted in a successful national campaign to improve conditions for Australian miners.",1937,-38.60572815,145.58853150,0,0,0,13,$0.00,0,0,VIC,http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=119,"$39,000,000.00",$0.00
272,Man made,Industrial,Mount Mulligan Mine,"The Mount Mulligan Mine incident occurred on 19 September 1921. The mine was known as a safe mine, as there was no detectable gas in the shafts. As a result miners worked with naked flames in light instead utilising safety lamps. This caused an explosion and claimed 75 lives.  A Royal Commission was established to investigate the incident. The findings discovered the explosion was caused by a fire damp (flammable gas found in coal mines) in combination with explosives which were stored, distributed and carried underground in a careless manner.",1921,-16.81308556,144.84031680,0,0,0,75,$0.00,0,0,QLD,http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=272,"$225,000,000.00",$0.00

The rescue coordinator and the nightshift manager also lost their lives during rescue efforts due to the effect of overpowering fumes.  The cause of the explosion was found to be the ignition of firedamp or methane gas supplying a miner's light. The explosion generated a coal dust explosion that destroyed a large portion of the mine.  There was a Royal Commission conducted into the origin of the explosion which determined that it was caused by the ignition of gas in the mine by the naked flames used as torches by the miners.",1902,-34.43048859,150.81816100,0,0,0,96,$0.00,0,0,NSW,http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=19,"$288,000,000.00",$0.00
521,Man made,Industrial,Bulli Mine,"On 23 March 1887 at 2.30 pm, a significant explosion occurred at the Bulli Colliery coal mine. The mine was renowned for having above average concentration of methane gas in specific areas.  It was normal practice for miners to unlock safety lamps, which improved both vision and productivity. The combination of methane gas and naked flame led to the explosion, killing 81 miners.  A commission was established to investigate the incident, and concluded poor attitudes towards safety by both miners and management created the ideal conditions for such an explosion.",1887,-34.42461014,150.89309690,0,0,0,81,$0.00,0,0,NSW,http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=521,"$243,000,000.00",$0.00

The explosion was caused by a spontaneous heating of fallen coal that developed into a fire approximately 300 m underground.  Efforts to contain or extinguish the fire failed and coal dust caused explosions that propagated the fire through the mine; killing 14 men underground and three at the surface. Included in the death toll were nine officials and employees of the mine and eight men from the mine's rescue station.",1972,-27.57159042,152.76214600,0,0,17,17,$0.00,0,0,QLD,http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=410,"$59,500,000.00",$0.00

Thirteen people attempting to contain the damage died.  In accordance with section 74 of the Coal Mining Act (1925) an inquiry was held to investigate the incident, with emphasis on determining the reasons for the disaster. The inquiry commenced on 10 November 1975, and closed on 24 November. Evidence presented to the inquiry showed the mine worked on a board and pillar system. This area was not extracted to the required height, thus coal was susceptible to spontaneous combustion. The inquiry found that the explosion was initiated by a spontaneous combustion source which ignited inflammable gas and was propagated by the existence of coal dust.",1975,-24.56211090,149.96955870,0,0,0,13,$0.00,0,0,QLD,http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=171,"$39,000,000.00",$0.00
