202,Transport,Road,Lake Illawarra,"The Lake Illawarra was a steel single screw steam turbine motor vessel, bulk carrier. The Lake Illawarra sank after running into and demolishing part of the Tasman Bridge that crossed the Derwent River at Hobart, 5 January 1975. The vessel was en route from Port Pirie in South Australia with a cargo of zinc. When approaching the bridge, the captain reduced speed, but was finding it difficult to align the ship to the central navigation span of the bridge. Despite several attempts to change the course, the ship was difficult to manage in part due to the lack of speed. The master finally called out full speed astern in a last attempt to change the course of the ship when the ship veered into the pile capping of Pier 18 and then Pier 19 bringing the three unsupported spans of the bridge crashing into vessels' hull. The ship sank within minutes in deep water.  Seven crew members on the ship died and four cars ran over the gap into the Derwent River, five occupants died while others managed to escape from the two vehicles which teetered on the edge of the gap. The collapse effectively divided Hobart in two. Police and emergency services were called into action and within an hour a ferry was traversing the river. The next day there were three private ferries and one government run ferry in operation. Eastern shore residents were severely hindered by the collapse as most hospitals, schools, businesses and government offices were located on the west shore.  A temporary bridge (the Bailey bridge) with one lane in each direction was built and opened to traffic on 16 December 1975. The federal government provided funding to rebuild the Tasman bridge at a cost of $44 million and it re-opened 8 October 1977.",1975,-42.94033813,147.38296510,0,0,0,12,$0.00,0,0,TAS,http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=202,"$36,000,000.00",$0.00

156,Transport,Road,Clybucca Flat (near Kempsey) Bus Collision,"In the early morning hours of 22 December 1989, two full tourist coaches collided head on at Clybucca Flat, 12 km north of Kempsey. The collision released the seats from their anchors, pushing seats and passengers forward. The force of impact left the Sydney (south) bound coach in the cabin of the Brisbane bound (north) coach. A major emergency response occurred with fleets of ambulance, helicopters, Sate Emergency Services, Fire brigade and Police attending the incident.  A New South Wales Coroners report found that the Sydney bound coach driver fell asleep at the wheel which resulted in the collision. The Coroner found the Sydney bound coach missed a bend on the highway and there was no indication that the driver had applied brakes or dimmed the headlights before the collision. Neither coach was speeding at the time of the crash, and no mechanical faults were found in either vehicle, the coroner said.  The coroner renewed calls for the creation of a dual-carriageway highway between Newcastle and the Queensland border, following an earlier 21 deaths in a coach/semi-trailer accident at Cowper, north of Grafton in October 1989 (see related event). The Coroner also recommended a review of coach seats, seat anchorages, seatbelts and better emergency exits for coaches, as rescuers were unable to enter the wreckage immediately because the exits were more than two metres above the ground.  As a result of the accident, 35 people died and 41 people were injured.",1989,-30.94066048,152.94444270,0,0,41,35,$0.00,0,0,NSW,http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=156,"$125,500,000.00",$0.00

The semi-trailer veered onto the wrong side of the highway and although the coach driver tried to swerve to avoid a collision it was unsuccessful. The collision tore the driver's side of the bus off, which threw passengers across the highway. The semi-trailer careered on after the collision and jack-knifed into a ditch. The coach ran into a roadside ditch, which halted only metres from a river.",1989,-29.56785774,153.08950810,0,0,22,21,$0.00,0,0,NSW,http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=273,"$74,000,000.00",$0.00
