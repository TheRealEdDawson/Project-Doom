460,Natural,Storm/Hail,Port Broughton,"On 14 November 1979 Port Broughton sustained damaged by a line of ferocious storms that hit south-eastern South Australia. Very strong winds and hail ruined solid brick houses, holiday shacks and caravans. Cars were pushed sideways along the road. Pine trees up to 30 m tall were uprooted.  There was no loss of life during the event which was considered to be amazing. Eleven people were injured requiring hospital admission, 60 others required hospital treatment.  While Port Broughton incurred the most damage, other areas were also affected by this weather event. Destruction was felt from the mid north to northern Adelaide Plains. Clare experienced severe damage; houses lost their roofs and sheds were demolished in the high winds. Likewise the northern suburbs of Adelaide saw houses unroofed and the trees blown over in areas such Salisbury North, Parafield Gardens, and Munno Para.  The agriculture industry was severely impacted with crops damaged, glass houses broken, grape vines stripped, storage tanks squashed, orchards destroyed and many farmers livelihoods built up over many years were lost within ten minutes.  According to the Bureau of Meteorology Regional Forecasting Centre, the thunderstorm triggered by the trough line that extended across Yorke Peninsula moved over Port Broughton and produced destructive winds. The winds at all levels through the atmosphere were very strong. A thunderstorm is classified as severe if it produces wind gusts of 90 km per hour of more. On this day gusts were much higher with reports of 135 km per hour to 160 km per hour. Isolated large hail coming from very cold air high above the earth's surface was rapidly transported to the surface by downdrafts and accompanied the thunderstorms associated with the trough immediately to the east causing damage to some of Adelaide&rsquo;s northern suburbs.  The Insurance Council of Australia estimated the 1979 damage at $10 million, with the 2011 normalised cost of $92 million.",1979,-33.60050201,137.93331910,0,150,71,0,"$10,000,000.00",0,0,SA,http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=460,"$142,500,000.00","$92,000,000.00",$92m

The strongest wind gusts during the storm were felt at Bathurst with 93 km per hour, Scone 93 km per hour, Kurnell 94 km per hour and Newcastle 91 km per hour.  The unseasonal cold weather brought snow to some areas of New South Wales where approximately 10-15 cm snow fell in the Snowy Mountains and temperatures reached as low as minus 5&deg;C. On the Brindabella Ranges near Canberra and on the Southern Tablelands, several centimetres of snow settled on the ground. Record low maximum and minimum temperatures occurred over this period, especially in the southern areas of the state.

Heavy rain, strong winds and large ocean swells resulted in widespread damage to coastal regions of the Hunter, Central Coast and Sydney Metropolitan areas. The Queen's birthday weekend east coast lows developed in a pre-existing trough of low pressure over the northern Tasman Sea.
