615,Natural,Flood,Victoria February 2012,"Heavy rain began in Victoria on 26 February 2012. A severe weather warning for flash flooding was issued for most of the state, including the South West, North Central, Northern Country, Wimmera, Mallee, Central, West and South Gippsland and North-East forecast districts.  The State Emergency Service (SES) responded to 650 calls for help across the state on the last days of February following heavy rain and thunderstorms. There was flash flooding and minor building damage across the state after rainfalls of between 50 and 100 mm. In towns such as Seymour there was 120 mm of rain causing flash flooding and road closures. Shops in the main street of Chiltern were flooded after 94 mm of rain fell. The Goulburn Valley Highway was closed north of Seymour due to rainfall. Broken Weir near Benalla recorded the highest rainfall with 167 mm. Castlemaine received 50 mm of rain in a 90 minute period. Police said 11 homes and six shops were flooded.  State Emergency Service (SES) crews were also kept busy dealing with flash flooding at Yarrawonga, Cobram and Shepparton. In addition they had over 350 calls for help in Melbourne, with the hardest hit areas including Brimbank, Doncaster, Emerald and Malvern. There were 89 calls for help in the Ballarat area when storms dumped almost 60 mm of rain. The Daylesford Hospital had some minor flooding, and streets and at least one building were flooded in the area.  On 1 March 2012, the Bureau of Meteorology issued a Severe Weather Warning for heavy rain for residents in the Northern Country, East Gippsland and North East forecast districts.  Broken Creek broke its banks and flooded the town of Numurkah, north of Shepparton. Numurkah Base Hospital and the adjoining Karinya Nursing Home both experienced flooding, with patients and residents evacuated. Flood waters peaked on 5 March and slowly receded with a State Emergency Service spokeswoman saying it would take at least a week for the water to recede completely. Approximately 40 homes and businesses were damaged. The hospital was later delared unsalvagable and limited services resumed from a temporary tent facility, followed by longstanding portables.  Locals and the SES in Nathalia constructed a temporary metal levee with thousands of sandbags, 750 m in length along the banks of Broken Creek, in an attempt to protect the town. Nathalia's temporary levee was purchased after floods hit the town in 1993; it has not been used until this event and it supplements a permanent levee around much of the Nathalia stretch of Broken Creek. Notwithstanding the levee the SES still issued an evacuation order for the town of Nathalia as some doubt existed as to the levees ability to contain the flood waters.  Flooding of Broken Creek, which flanks Nathalia, peaked on 9 March at 3.25 m. The town's evacuation notice was lifted 15 March 2012 and the metal levee dismantled on 20 March 2012.  To date the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments total approximately $7,773,000 allocated to 6897 claimants.  The Insurance Council of Australia estimated the 2012 damage at $108.2 million which incorporated figures for both New South Wales and Victoria.",2012,-36.12789154,141.99279790,0,0,0,0,"$108,212,000.00",0,0,VIC,http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=615,"$108,212,000.00","$108,212,000.00"

50,Natural,Flood,"Queensland - Charleville, New South Wales - Nyngan, Victoria - Gippsland","On 18 April 1990 after several weeks of heavy rain over Queensland, a strong upper level low dumped upwards of 150 mm of rain with exceptional totals to 350 mm across large areas of central Queensland over a three day period. Already saturated catchments were inundated and major flooding quickly developed on the Warrego and Maranoa Rivers and many other inland systems. The towns of Jericho and Augathella were flooded and a section of the Longreach railway was washed away.  On the morning of 21 April, the Warrego River was rising rapidly. Later the same day the river peaked at over 8.5 m which was 1.5 m above the previous record. Levee banks protecting the town were ineffective and floodwaters spread through the town, necessitating the entire population of 3500 to be evacuated to the airport. Many residents climbed to their rooftops and had to be rescued by helicopter.  The low then moved south-east and torrential rains were experienced across large areas of New South Wales west of the Divide. There was major flooding on the Lachlan, Macquarie and Castlereagh Rivers, among others. The Bogan river flooded into Nyngan. Despite the residents' ttempts to raise the levee banks by sand bagging, the levees could not withstand the flood and on the 23 April, as the river surged to 5.2 m, nearly one metre higher than the previous record, most of the town was inundated. The population of 2500 was evacuated to Dubbo, 160 km away.  The low then moved towards Victoria and produced torrential rains over Gippsland on 20 and 21 April with up to 350 mm recorded over the two day period. Major flooding occurred on the Thomson, Avon and Mitchell Rivers. Hectares of vegetable crops were destroyed by flood waters and highways cut. People were evacuated from low-lying areas.

Metre-deep flooding entered East's League's Club, forcing 50 patrons to be evacuated. About 30 cars were submerged in the club car park. Many houses throughout Brisbane's southern suburbs were also flooded. Over 100 homes were inundated in Wishart (southern suburb). Heavy rain downed powerlines at Annerley, Woolloongabba, Greenslopes and Holland Park. A block of flats at Greenslopes had the roof torn off. Cars that were stalled on flooded roads caused peak-hour traffic chaos. Many cars that had been left in flooded streets floated away. A car dealership in Salisbury reported damage to about 50 vehicles.  Three flights were diverted from Brisbane Airport to the Amberley RAAF Base after lights along the Brisbane runway went out (due to lightning). A house boat, moored on Norman Creek in eastern Brisbane, was damaged. The northern suburbs of McDowall, Windsor, Ferny Hills, Arana Hills and Everton Hills also recorded severe water damage.

The substantial rain event followed the Great Divide Bushfires, when 1.2 million hectares of public and private land were burnt and large areas of soil were left exposed.   The storm in June 2007 resulted in major flooding and widespread damage. Seven rivers burst their banks causing millions of dollars of damage to homes, businesses and farms, as well as a significant loss of public and private assets. The rapidly rising floodwaters forced dozens of rescues and evacuations. One person died as a result of the flood waters. During 48 hours of torrential rain more than 1000 emergency service staff worked to save homes and shops in towns throughout Gippsland. Relief centres were set up at Bairnsdale, Lakes Entrance, Paynesville, Sale, Lucknow and Loch Sport and housed up to 360 evacuees. Volunteers also provided medical aid and catering with other organisations such as the Lions Club.

The following river systems were affected; Richmond, Clarence, Bellinger, Nambucca, Macleay, Hastings, Manning, Paterson and Hunter. The rising water exceeded levees in Kempsey and the traffic bridge at Kempsey peaked at a height of 6.9 m. Other significant damage included; 94 businesses with an estimated direct cost of $28,000 per business, streets closed to traffic and 100 people evacuated from the Mirriwina Gardens settlement (50 km north-west of Kempsey).  The Clarence River also threatened to exceed levees causing precautionary evacuations of more than 1000 people, including 80 patients from the Grafton Hospital. The Grafton levee bank was able to hold the water within the river system, which finally peaked at 7.75 m.  The effects of the flooding were wide spread and inundations and dislocation of services affected up to 28 local government areas.The Pacific Highway, the main route in many of these regions, was cut for several days. Rail services were also reported as suspended. Furthermore, reports of damage included; Yamba becoming isolated, Gladstone and Smithtown where sewerage infrastructure failed and Ulmarra (population of 470) was ordered to evacuate. Bellingen, Thora, Kaland and Darkwood, South West Rocks, Hat Head, and Crescent Head were isolated and required food and medical drops by helicopter.  The response units included; State Emergency Services (SES) a contingent of 1300 volunteers from 83 units, Rural Fire Service (RFS), New South Wales Fire Brigade (NSWFB), Volunteer Rescue Association (VRA), Police, and Council workers. Additional supporting equipment used in the response included; ten heavy tankers, 12 flood boats, and 11 helicopters.  Estimated costs to roads and bridges was $3 million, water and sewerage infrastructure $500,000.  The enormity of the recovery resulted in the Premier establishing a Government Task Force to coordinate the operation. Brigadier Philip McNamara was appointed the regional coordinator for the recovery, and was based in Coffs Harbour.

612,Natural,Flood,New South Wales - 2012,"The combination of a high pressure system over the southern Tasman Sea and a trough over Queensland directed moist east to north-easterly winds across New South Wales. This generated patchy rain areas and isolated thunderstorms and heavy rain over the north of the state.  Minor to major flood warnings were issued for communities on the Mid North, Coffs Harbour and North Coast of New South Wales. There were reports of 300 mm falling in the space of three days in areas of the Bellinger River Valley and the Orara River catchment.  More than 2000 people were isolated by the rising floodwaters, with a number of road closures such as at the Pacific Highway and a caravan park in a low lying area evacuated.  From the 24 - 25 January New South Wales received almost 340 mm of rain. Overnight on the 24 January, the Tweed Valley saw heavy falls with 86 mm of rain at Couchy Creek, 100 mm at Numinbah and 100 mm at Bald Mountain.  Residents were isolated in the towns of Darkwood, near Coffs Harbour, the Thora and Kalang Valleys, and in Bellingen, on the Mid North Coast, where the flooded Bellinger River cut the town in two. More than a dozen homes and businesses in Bellingen were inundated. The Bellinger River at the Bellingen Bridge peaked at around 7 m, short of the 8.2 m that constitutes major flooding.  A landslide and waterfalls blocked the Waterfall Way between Dorrigo and Bellingen. Bellingen received 180 mm of rain in the 24 hours to 9 am on 27 January.  During this time the State Emergency Services received more than 1000 calls for assistance and over 50 flood rescues occurred.

On 5 February the Namoi River peaked at over 8 m in Gunnedah and the Mehi River near Moree reached more than 10.6 m, similar to the height reached in 1976 floods. Approximately 300 homes in Moree were inundated, and 1600 people were evacuated.  The concern became from floodwaters from Queensland moving downstream to northern areas of New South Wales such as Mungindi, Walgett, Bourke, Collarenebri and Brewarrina.  On 9 February, heavy rains caused flash flooding across western Sydney and the Illawarra, with the SES receiving approximately 450 calls for assistance.  On 20 February a similar event occurred with flash flooding across Sydney and the Illawarra prompting more than 300 requests for assistance to the SES. Terry Hills recorded 61 mm in an hour and Peakhurst recorded 26 mm in just ten minutes. Other suburbs affected included Banksia, Rockdale, Padstow Heights, Sylvania, Five Dock and Rosebery.  Up to 8000 people remained isolated for weeks in the north-west, receiving approximately 50 ton of daily deliveries such as medication, mail and food.

613,Natural,Flood,Queensland Jan 2012,"From 24 January 2012, south-east Queensland experienced very high rainfall across the region with totals up to 200 mm recorded in a 24 hour period.  Floods occurred in some areas and homes were evacuated, power outages occurred and several roads were closed as the heavy rain continued.  The State Emergency Service (SES) received approximately 500 requests for assistance between midnight and 4 pm across south-east Queensland. The SES efforts focused on the north side of Brisbane, in Boondall, Zillmere, Herston and Aspley. Most requests for assistance were for minor damage to properties and general and storm damage. On 24 January, evacuation centres were opened at Narangba and Deception Bay, north of Brisbane. Twelve homes were evacuated as a precaution at Burpengary, north of Brisbane, and another dozen homes were flooded further north on the Sunshine Coast. Power was cut to approximately 9500 homes and businesses across the south-east. Overnight Upper Springbrook recorded some of the heaviest rain falls, with 193 mm in the 12 hours to 6 am. Lower Springbrook recorded 173 mm, Upper Tallebudgera 142 mm and 127 mm at Mt Tamborine. Brisbane city and suburbs had between 80 and 120 mm of rain and Caloundra on the Sunshine Coast recorded 271 mm in just ten hours.  Thirteen dams across south-east Queensland began spilling water to cope with the deluge, which included 220 mm falls over 30 hours in some parts.  Council run Australia Day events planned for the Moreton Bay Region and for the Gold Coast's Evandale Parklands were forced to cancel due to the heavy rain.  The State Emergency Services received more than 650 calls for assistance on the morning of 27 January.   On 3 February a state of emergency was declared in Mitchell and approximately a quarter of the population was evacuated.. The Queensland Government requested assistance from the Australian Defence Force to provide aerial support and aid evacuations. The Maranoa River reached 9.85 m, breaking its 1956 record peak of 9.26 m. Almost half the population took refuge in a sports complex and when the flood threatened to isolate the complex helicopters were sent in to air-lift people to safety.  By 4 February the Warrego River in Charleville reached 7.7 m and over 280 homes were inundated when floodwaters in Roma peaked at 8.35 m. Approximately 50 per cent of homes experienced some form of inundation. More than 700 homes or businesses in the region needed assistance, and more than 440 were damaged with approximately 288 properties affected in Mitchell and 290 affected in Roma. One hundred and twenty Australian Defence Force soldiers assisted with the clean up in these regions.  On 5 February mandatory evacuations were ordered for St George after it was predicted the Balonne River would peak at up to 15 m. With more than 2600 people from a population of 3000 evacuated, it was Queensland&rsquo;s largest evacuation in history. The Balonne River in St George passed its previous record of 13.48 m, peaking at 13.93 m, but the township remained protected by its 14.5 m levee with damage restricted to the 50 homes. St George also faced pollution problems as floodwaters damaged the local sewerage treatment plant, posing a major public health risk.  At the beginning of March, a category one cyclone off the south-east coast caused further flooding and six evacuation centres were opened across the coast to assist evacuated and displaced people.  The National Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements (NDRRA) identified the Local Government Areas of Aurukun, Burdekin, Burke, Cairns, Carpentaria, Cassowary Coast, Charters Towers, Cook, Doomadgee, Hinchinbrook, Kowanyama, Mackay, Mapoon, Mornington, Napranum, Northern Peninsula, Palm Island, Pormpuraaw, Tablelands, Townsville City, Torres Strait Islands and Yarrabah as natural disaster zones.

The heaviest rain spread into Victoria, resulting in record rainfall in parts of west and north-west Victoria. This, combined with saturated conditions of the catchment and floodplains, caused severe flooding.  Jeparit recorded the highest daily rainfall of 161.2 mm, with seven other monitoring stations breaking their highest daily rainfall records. Weather stations at Kyneton, Annuello, Rupanyup and Maryborough observed their highest ever rainfall total for anymonth on record.  The Wimmera, Avoca, Loddon and Campaspe river catchment areas all reached record flood peaks. The Barwon catchment and the Lerderderg River in the Werribee catchment also experienced major flooding. The towns of Charlton, Bridgewater, Carisbrook, Rochester, Horsham and Echuca experienced the greatest levels of inundation.

Flood warnings were issued for the Macleay, Severn, Macintyre, Gwydir, Mehi, Namoi and Peel Rivers.New South Wales State Emergency Service volunteers prepared Wee Waa with food and emergency supplies, with predictions that the swollen Namoi River would isolate the town for some days. The rising waters made the roads in Wee Waa inaccessible to all but four-wheel drive vehicles. Water levels exceeded 6 m around 9:00 am on 27 November, before reaching 7 m on 29 November with major flooding.  Approximately 300 properties were isolated in Moree, and the town was cut in two after rising waters forced the closure of the local bridge.More properties were cut off in Gunnedah and the village of Garah, as waters in the Namoi, Gwydir, Peel and Mehi Rivers continued to rise. One person drowned after being pulled into a storm water drain in Bingara, near Inverell.  As the flood waters abated and moved downstream, the Department of Primary Industries were able to assess the flood damage. Hundreds of livestock, mainly sheep, died with most of the losses occurring between Garah and Weemelah. Fodder drops will continue to provide quality feed.  It has been estimated that approximately $52 million in flood damage has occurred to the cotton industry in the Gwydir Valley. The local growers' association says initial estimates are based on around 18,000 hectares; up to 30 per cent of the dryland crop and five per cent of irrigated crop being damaged. It warns these figures could worsen as the floodwaters move downstream inundating more cotton and upstream crops begin to emerge.

In Brisbane a very wet 1973 occurred and the rains had already resulted in some flooding when, on 24 January, cyclone Wanda hit the north of the city. Wanda came with relatively little wind, but produced record rains over the Australia Day holiday. Over the long weekend, Brisbane received 580 mm of rain, with much higher falls over river catchments near the city (1,300 mm in five days at Mt Glorious). Approximately 40 houses situated on the banks of the rivers and creeks were washed away as rivers flooded to their highest levels since the 1893 floods.  Fourteen lives were lost in the floods and many people had to be rescued from rising waters.  Record floods were also reported in New South Wales with much of the state affected. In May 1974, record flood levels occurred in the Ovens and Maribyrnong rivers in Victoria. Many settlements in South Australia were also badly affected; Oodnadatta, Marree, Moomba, Iron Knob, Andamooka and Coober Pedy were cut off by flood waters.
