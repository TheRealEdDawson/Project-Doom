4,Transport,Rail,Granville Rail Disaster,"On 18 January 1977, a passenger train left Mount Victoria in the Blue Mountains for Sydney. Whilst negotiating a left hand curve 250 m west of the Granville Railway Station, the train derailed causing it to collide with the northern trestle supporting the Bold Street Bridge. The bridge collapsed on the train, destroying one carriage and crushing two others.  The derailed locomotive demolished the eight stanchions of the northern trestle, sheering a power pylon from its base before overturning. Eight people died when the top of the first carriage was demolished as it caught the power pylon. The second carriage stopped clear of the bridge. The third and fourth carriages were crushed when the unsupported northern span of the 30 m wide bridge collapsed, killing 83 people. The following four carriages remained on the rails, causing injuries to 210 passengers.  A Departmental and Judicial Inquiry found that poor maintenance was a critical factor, with no evidence to support any offence against the driver and the crew.  On the twentieth anniversary of the disaster, a memorial was erected at Granville containing the names of the deceased.",1977,-33.83146286,151.00996400,0,0,210,83,$0.00,0,0,NSW,http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=4,"$354,000,000.00",$0.00,Not known
455,Transport,Rail,Sunshine Rail Collision,"On 20 April 1908, a train packed with holiday makers returning to Melbourne from Ballarat was struck by another train coming from Bendigo. The Ballarat train was scheduled to arrive at Sunshine at 10.03 pm but was running late. When it did arrive at the station it had to stop twice to allow passengers in the rear coaches to alight due to the length of the train.  The train from Bendigo was due to arrive at Sunshine at 10.30 pm but was running late and therefore travelling at reasonable speed to try and make up time. As the train from Ballarat prepared to leave on its final leg into Melbourne it was struck from behind by the train from Bendigo hauled by two 'AA class' engines.  The impact of the collision at 10.50 pm demolished the guards van and the rear four carriages. Gas from one of the trains caught fire. Darkness impeded rescue efforts with only lamp light and light from the fire available. It was not until 1.00 am that a relief train arrived with doctors, nurses and an ambulance corp.  In all, 44 people were killed and 413 injured with 72 of the injuries being serious. All lives lost occurred on the Ballarat train.

On the morning of 7 February 1969, it was Melbourne bound travelling at 120 km per hour with 190 passengers on board.  The Express crashed head on with an Albury bound goods train. The collision crushed the first two carriages of the Express, which held sleeping accommodation, and the third and fourth carriage were tossed from the track and landed on top of the locomotive. As the passengers from the Express were trying to leave the train an explosion occurred igniting fires in seven of the trains' carriages. Nine people died and 40 people were injured. Many passengers were located in the largely undamaged dining car for breakfast at the time of the collision and had only recently vacated the badly damaged sleeping cars, otherwise there would have been a much greater number of deaths and injuries.

The train was estimated to weigh 600 tonnes and only three wagons had vacuum brakes. The line to Wokalup was almost all downhill and shortly into the journey the train started to gather speed at an alarming rate. The train left the line on a sharp 'S' bend.

112,Transport,Rail,Cootamundra Train Derailment,"On 25 January 1885, seven people were killed and more than 20 injured when the Melbourne to Sydney overnight express train heavily booked due to a race meet in Sydney the next day derailed.   Over 25 cm of rain had fallen in south-west New South Wales and washed away the culvert and railway track over Salt Clay Creek. When the track inspector realised the collapse of the track had occurred, attempts were made to contact the express train through Bethungra Station, however communication lines were down.   Due to the speed the train was going the locomotive almost made it across the gap. It crashed into the opposite bank of the creek. The carriages behind jack-knifed while the passengers were asleep. Help was raised from Cootamundra with a doctor and a chemist quickly arriving at the scene. Injured passengers were later transported to Goulburn Hospital when Cootamundra could no longer cope. The Railways Department was criticised in a later enquiry for building such a small culvert, insufficient to carry the volumes of water that occurred in the flash flood.",1885,-34.65298080,148.01460270,0,0,20,7,$0.00,0,0,NSW,http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=112,"$31,000,000.00",$0.00,Not known

531,Transport,Rail,Bogantungan Railway Accident,"During late February, areas around Bogantungan and Alpha experienced heavy rainfalls resulting in floods.  At Medway Creek west of Bogantungan, the river flowed under the rail bridge which was lined with old gum trees. Overnight on 25 February, a 12 tonne gum tree was swept into the creek, dislodging the pile that supported the 64 m stone and timber rail bridge.  Shortly after 2.30 am on 26 January, the bridge collapsed as the Rockhampton-bound Midlander passed over it. The first of the two locomotives cleared the bridge but derailed and the C17, generator car and two sleeping carriages derailed and fell into the creek 7.6 m below.

40,Transport,Rail,Brooklyn Train Collision,"On 6 May 1990, a Sydney-bound commuter train travelling from Newcastle crashed into the rear of a stalled chartered steam train. The 3801 locomotive, also bound for Sydney, had stopped on a rise from the Hawkesbury River and was building up steam to get up the grade (Cowan Bank) when the Sydney bound train emerged from the Boronia tunnel near Brooklyn and collided with the 3801.  The accident happened 5 km south of the Brooklyn Bridge, between the Hawkesbury River and the town of Cowan. A total of 93 people were injured and six people died. The front of the four-carriage Sydney train was derailed in the accident.  An interim ban was placed on the use of steam locomotives on the New South Wales railway system.  A Coronial inquiry found that a railway signal fault occurred due to sand being dumped on the rail by the driver of 3801 to provide traction when the train went into a violent wheel-spin as it approached the Boronia tunnel. A handbrake in one of the steam train's carriages may have been partially applied, the inquiry found, to cause the train to slow down. Just outside the tunnel, the driver opened the valve to full throttle and the steam train pulled to a complete stop and more sand was applied to the rails.  While the 3801 was attempting to climb the hill, the Sydney - Newcastle train was stopped at a red signal on the other side of the tunnel. The lights apparently fluctuated from red to green seemingly because of sand on the rails. When the lights stayed permanently on the green the urban train moved forward through the tunnel, when the crash with 3801 occurred. The force of the impact destroyed the last carriage of the historic train and demolished the front carriage of the Sydney train.  Those involved in the incident were cleared of blame, however, it was said that although the signals had tested satisfactorily, the sand applied to the line by 3801 may have caused them to malfunction on the day.",1990,-33.54511642,151.22560120,0,0,93,6,$0.00,0,0,NSW,http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=40,"$64,500,000.00",$0.00,Not known

As there was much debris on the track, a breakdown train was sent to the scene to assist with the clean up.

A large section of the body-side was torn away by the truck trailer and several seats on the right side of the car were torn from their mountings. The truck trailer then struck the front right corner of the third car breaching the occupied area. The draft yoke connecting the second and third cars fractured and the third car derailed both cars.
