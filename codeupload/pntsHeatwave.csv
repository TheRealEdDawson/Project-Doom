1,Natural,Heatwave,South-Eastern Australia Heatwave 1939,"An extreme heatwave occurred in south-eastern Australia, January 1939. It was long lasting with very high temperatures. On 9 January the temperature at Kyancutta (South Australia) reached 49.3 &deg;C, the highest temperature recorded in South Australia at that time.  Many temperature records were made during this heatwave, some of which have held until the recent 2009 heatwave; Adelaide, 46.1 &deg;C, on 12 January, Melbourne, 45.6&deg;C on 13 January, Sydney, 45.3&deg;C on 14 January with Manly and Richmond both reaching over 47 &deg;C. In northern New South Wales some places reached 48 &deg;C on 15 January. Menindee in western New South Wales reached 49.7 &deg;C.  High temperatures were experienced inland in 1939; at Mildura the temperature exceeded 37.8 &deg;C on each of the first 14 days of January, and at the peak of the heatwave, averaged 45.6&deg;C from 7-14 January. It is estimated that more than 400 deaths in Victoria were caused by excessive heat.

The heatwave came in two major episodes, 28-31 January and 6-8 February.  In much of central, southern and western Victoria, maximum temperatures widely reached their highest levels since at least 1939. In Melbourne the temperature was above 43 &deg;C for three consecutive days from 28 to 30 January, reaching a peak of 45.1 &deg;C, the second highest on record behind 45.6 &deg;C in 1939.  In southern South Australia maximum temperatures widely reached their highest levels since at least 1939. Adelaide peaked at 45.7 &deg;C on 28 January and South Australia's highest temperature was 48.2 &deg;C at Kyancutta.  There were widespread power outages across both states. In Victoria, up to 500,000 homes and businesses were left without electricity. There were also major disruptions to train services with more than 1300 trains cancelled as rails buckled and air-conditioning failed.

4212,Natural,Heatwave,National Heatwave,"From late December 2012 to early January 2013, Australia experienced a nationwide heatwave. Temperatures peaked throughout Australia, forcing the Bureau of Meteorology to add new colours (deep purple and pink) to its weather forecasting chart to record temperatures above 50&deg;C.  Australia&rsquo;s first six days of 2013 were among the hottest 20 days on record in terms of average maximums. The heatwave developed over a large region stretching from northern Victoria and inland New South Wales to central-west Queensland, across to north-western Western Australia and down to the Nullarbor coast.The national average maximum across Australia on 7 January was 40.33 &deg;C, beating the previous record set in 1972 by 0.16&deg;C.  In Perth, temperatures exceeded 37&deg;C for seven consecutive days. This heatwave caused 20 people to be hospitalised between the period 27 December and 3 January. St John Ambulance reported a doubling in call-outs for heatstroke, dehydration and burns from the previous week. On New Year&rsquo;s Eve, Western Australia recorded 42.1 &deg;C, 13 &deg;C above the December average. The state's average temperature for the last week of 2012 averaged a maximum of 39.3 &deg;C, making it the hottest week in 80 years. Records were broken in Alice Springs, with temperatures over 40 &deg;C for 17 days in a row and Oodnadatta, where temperatures exceeded 45 &deg;C for seven consecutive days.  On 17, January Sydney endured its hottest day ever, with a record temperature of 45.8 &deg;C. The Ambulance Service of New South Wales reported that more than 220 people had been treated for heat exposure or fainting. The heatwave stranded thousands of commuters, with dozens of trains delayed as steel wires buckled and a hose used to run a key signalling system melted. On the central coast, the heat caused an overhead wire to buckle onto a train at approximately 1.30 pm, trapping about 250 passengers for half an hour.  There was a noted increase in nationwide hospital admissions for kidney disease, acute renal failure and heart attacks across this period.
