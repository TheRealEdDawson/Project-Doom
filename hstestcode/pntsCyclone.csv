503,Natural,Cyclone,Cyclone Yasi,"Cyclone Yasi developed as a tropical low north-west of Fiji on 29 January 2011. On 30 January, it was named Yasi by the Fiji Meteorological Service. On 2 February, it was upgraded to a Category 5 system and made landfall near Mission Beach (138 km south of Cairns) between midnight and 1 am (AEST) early on Thursday 3 February. It weakened to a tropical low near Mount Isa around 10 pm on 3 February.  In response to warnings about the expected severity of the cyclone, and possible storm surges, approximately 10,000 northern Queenslanders living in low-lying areas evacuated to more than 100 official evacuation centres. Significant numbers were accommodated in unofficial evacuation centres established by communities and church groups. Thousands of people left the area and sought refuge with family and friends.  Flights out of the region were fully booked. The entire hospital population, more than 300 patients, were evacuated to other regional hospitals and Brisbane by the the Australian Defence Force, Royal Flying Doctor Service and other methods.  This was an unprecedented evacuation effort.  The eye of the cyclone passed over Dunk Island and Mission Beach between Innisfail and Townsville bringing significant winds, the highest estimated at 285 km per hour. Considerable damage occurred to the towns of Tully, Cardwell, Tully Heads, Innisfail, Ingham, Mission Beach, El Arish, Silkwood and Silky Oak and localities, however, the cyclone&rsquo;s worst impact missed the major centres of Townsville and Cairns. Overall, approximately 1000 people reported significant damage to their homes. Other impacts include power loss to more than 200,000 properties, cars were found metres away from where they were left and boats were piled on top of each other in some regions.  Rainfall totals for the 24 hour period to 9 am Thursday 3 February were 200-300 mm in the area between Cairns and Ayr, causing some flooding. A 5 m tidal surge was observed at the storm tide gauge at Cardwell. Other sea inundation occurred between the beaches north of Cairns and Alva Beach, and there was some inundation in parts of the city of Townsville.  The Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics and Sciences estimated the cyclone caused a $300 million hit to agriculture, particularly affecting banana and sugarcane crops.  The Federal Government processed over $250 million worth of recovery grants in the first three weeks after the storm through Centrelink. Financial help was also available in the form of concessional loans for cyclone hit farmers up to $650,000.  There was one recorded death.

345,Natural,Cyclone,Cyclone Vance,"Cyclone Vance developed off the coast of Darwin between 17 and 18 March, intensifying as it tracked to the west south-west then to the south before crossing the coast near Exmouth on 22 March as a Category 5 system. Wind speeds were recorded at 267 km per hour at Learmonth and 174 km per hour at Onslow. By the 23 March at 4 am it was near the town of Mount Magnet and was moving southeast at 50 km per hour.  Cyclone Vance was downgraded to Category 1 and passed to the northeast of Kalgoorlie on the 23 March 2011 at approximately 3 pm.  The storm surge associated with Cyclone Vance caused severe erosion of the beachfront and marina at Exmouth and stranded three large barges on the edge of Beadon Creek at Onslow. The storm surge at Exmouth was measured at 3.5 m which resulted in a storm tide of 4.9 m.  Severe structural damage occurred to approximately 10 per cent of buildings in Exmouth; many more experienced less obvious damage due to the intrusion of rainwater. Other damage was recorded in the far west of Pilbara, including damage in the town of Cue.

On 28 January, the most extreme daily rainfall for the week occurred over the Gold Coast Hinterland and New South Wales border catchment and the edge of the Brisbane river catchment where rainfall for a 24 hour period was in excess of 700 mm both hitting record levels. The Queensland State Emergency Service received 1800 calls for help in 24 hours on the 28 January, mostly in the south-east areas of the state.  Six people were killed due to the extreme weather over the course of the week. Thousands were forced to evacuate, 2000 people were isolated by floodwaters for some days requiring emergency supply drops.

On 27 January, the system moved south impacting Brisbane, the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast with damaging to destructive winds, torrential rain, dangerous surf and tidal inundation for a 24 hour period. Winds reached 131 km per hour at Cape Byron. Mt Crosby water treatment plant was shut down owing to turbidity in the Brisbane River. Water was released from the Wivenhoe dam from 91per cent to 88 per cent to cope with flood waters. Water was also released from North Pine Dam and Somerset Dam.  Torrential rainfall and flooding also occurred in northern New South Wales particularly near Lismore and Grafton where approximately 2000 evacuations occurred. The New South Wales State Emergency Service attended to more than 2900 calls for assistance Eight New South Wales river systems had flood warnings in place. Coastal erosion of beaches was evidenced in these regions along with sea foam covering some roads and parks on the Gold and Sunshine Coasts.  Overall, Bundaberg was the worst affected city with 2000 homes and 200 businesses inundated with flood water. The Burnett river was running at approximately 70 km per hour and threatening houses. Despite a mandatory evacuation order issued to 5000 residents, an emergency airlift was the only option for some stranded residents. Eighteen helicopters were utilised in a rescue effort evacuating more than 1000 people trapped by flood waters in North Bundaberg and other most-at-risk areas to at least nine evacuation centres which was a record evacuation effort in Australia. The Bundaberg hospital was also evacuated and approximately 130 patients were transferred to hospitals in Brisbane.  On 31 January, in North Bundaberg, approximately 7000 residents were forced out of their homes and not allowed to return until they were checked and declared safe.
