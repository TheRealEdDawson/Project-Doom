603,Natural,Riptide,Bondi's Black Sunday,"The 6 February 1938 was a particularly hot day that attracted approximately 35,000 people to Bondi beach, Sydney. The surf was rough, with a record of 74 people pulled from the waves before lunch.  In the early afternoon the temperature was approximately 40 &ordm; C and there were almost 750 bathers in the water. Three 'dumpers' or large waves fell upon the beach, pushing water 30 m up the sand and causing a huge rip as it receded. Many of the swimmers were caught in the rip, unable to return to shore.  There were 60 lifesavers on the beach at the time, and in approximately 20 minutes they rescued 245 people; Australia's largest rescue operation. Medical centres were set up on the sand, and approximately 60 people were rescued from immersion and 35 revived from an unconscious state. However five people died, and the Coroner found the cause to be accidental drowning.",1938,-33.89019012,151.27423100,0,0,95,5,$0.00,0,0,NSW,http://www.emknowledge.gov.au/resource/?id=603,"$62,500,000.00",$0.00
