22,Natural,Bushfire,Great Divide Complex,"Victoria experienced a very adverse fire season during 2006 - 2007. Lightning ignited a number of fires on 1 December 2006 and some later merged to form what is known as the 'Great Divide Complex' fires in eastern Victoria. The area burnt mostly public land and was estimated to be in the vicinity of 1.2 and 1.3 million hectares by the end of the season. On 7 February 2007, The Great Divide fires were finally contained after 69 days. There were also a number of other fires (Tawonga Gap burned 33,500 hectares and Tatong burned 33,000). Despite the severity of the fire season, housing and private asset losses were remarkably low. In total, 51 dwellings of which 21 were classified as primary residences were destroyed and hundreds of stock and farm fencing were lost in the fires. One man died in a vehicle accident while assisting a property owner to prepare for fire impact.  Thousands of community volunteers and career emergency service personnel across state, regional and community levels worked in partnership to ensure the fires were eventually brought under control. A further component to the response was the support and assistance from New Zealand, United States, Canadian and interstate colleagues.  By 7 February, more than 1400 firefighters had been injured in the fire fighting effort (including bruises, cuts, blisters, burns, dehydration, broken limbs and spider bites). More than 400 St John Ambulance volunteers, including doctors, nurses and first aid officers provided medical assistance. On 16 December, 11 New Zealand firefighters were injured while fighting the fire in the Howqua Valley in north-east Victoria.  On 16 January 2007 power lines were cut which severely disrupted Melbourne electricity supplies. On the same day, a fire threatened to close Tullamarine Airport. The Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE) worked with Melbourne Water to keep the fires out of the water catchments.  A significant number of people were evacuated during the fires. Relief centres were established to accommodate evacuees. Some mountain tourist complexes were evacuated due to fires including Mount Buller and Thredbo Village in New South Wales, the latter due to a fire that started from a lightning strike at Hermit Mountain and crossed the border.  Victoria experienced widespread effects from the fires. Numerous schools in the high country and some parts of Gippsland were forced to close due to the fire threat and outside play at school was banned in some instances due to smoke haze. The smoke haze reportedly caused some respiratory symptoms and aggravated conditions such as asthma. Haze also ffected traffic and delayed flights in and out of Melbourne airport. On 20 December, the Environment Protection Authority recorded its worst bushfire smoke since records began, with visibility reduced to two km in Melbourne's central business district.  During the fire season, the Country Fire Authority, Department of Sustainability and Environment and Parks Victoria received operational assistance from other states and a significant international contingent:    ACT - 37 personnel  NSW - 1050 personnel  NT - 108 personnel  SA - 10 personnel  Qld - 14 personnel  WA - 20 personnel  Canada - 52 personnel  New Zealand - 115 personnel  USA - 114 personnel    The Victorian and Federal Government provided financial assistance to aid personal, physical and economic recovery from the fire disaster.

4781,Natural,Bushfire,New South Wales 2013,"During October 2013, approximately 100 fires burnt across eastern New South Wales, including six major bushfires. The most serious fires started in the Blue Mountains on 16 and 17 October.  The fires began on 13 October when strong winds and high temperatures caused a fire near Port Stephens and destroyed six houses. Several sheds and cars were also burnt in the fires and dozens of residents spent the night in evacuation centres. One person died at Lake Munmorah while protecting their home. Fires also occurred around the Hunter and Hawksbury regions. At the same time, more than 100 firefighters were fighting bushfires at Tangory Mountain, Webbs Creek, Wollemi National Park, the Southern Highlands and the Central Coast.  On 16 October, a defence training exercise at Marrangaroo near the Blue Mountains, accidently sparked a fire that became known as the &lsquo;State Mine Fire&rsquo;. It had a perimeter of 190km and eventually burnt nearly 46,000 hectares between Lithgow and Mt Tomah. At its most severe, the fire travelled 25 km per hour through bushland.  Thousands of people in Lithgow were evacuated and the communities of Bell, Bilpin, Berambing, Clarence, Dargan, Hartley Vale, Mount Wilson were also affected. The fire devastated the recently restored tourist attraction, Zig Zag Railway, with equipment and train carriages destroyed.  On 17 October two more major fires began in the lower Blue Mountains: one near Mt Victoria and the other at Springwood. Wimallee and Yellowrock were the worst affected communities with 193 homes destroyed and 100 damaged. Staff and patients at the Springwood Hospital were evacuated as a precaution. With the three fires burning uncontrollably in the Blue Mountains, on 18 October, Victoria sent fire crews and equipment to assist with the NSW firefighting efforts. A State of Emergency was announced for NSW on 20 October.  By 22 October the State Mine Fire had travelled south and was threatening to join up with the Mt Victoria Fire. The Rural Fire Service decided to deliberately allow the State Mine Fire to join the Mount Victoria Fire in a controlled way by managing fuel loads and back-burning to create firebreaks. While this was a high risk strategy, by 25 October cooler weather conditions allowed firefighters to bring the three Blue Mountains Fires under control. The fires were declared extinguished on 13 November. A total of approximately 118,000 hectares was burnt across the state.

The whole of Victoria was covered in smoke, it is estimated that 75 per cent of the state was affected to some extent. Despite the number of fires burning and the harsh conditions, more fires were lit by bushmen and graziers attempting to protect themselves from the fires, only to have them lose control and spread.  The first deaths occurred on 8 January when two people died in the Toolangi State Forest.  By 10 January, almost all the forests in the Great Dividing Range were on fire. There was a large outbreak around the town of Erica, north-east of Moe, and at Powelltown between Yarra Junction and Noojee.

On 16 February itself, there was low humidity, heat wave conditions and strong to gale force winds. Temperatures varied between high thirties and mid forties over most of eastern South Australia and Victoria with relative humidity generally less than 15 per cent.  The Victorian bushfire season had started in November 1982. There were 854 bushfires reported at this time including, Ballan, Mount Macedon on 1 February, Cann River and Mount Donna Buang.  On early Ash Wednesday morning there were 104 fires already burning in Victoria most controlled or contained, it was only after 2.00 pm that the situation exploded.  The Victorian fires formed several complexes.  1. Western district near Warrnambool. This fire started from a defective private power line. The resulting fire front was kilometres wide and moving at frightening speed. A cool change came through at 5.00 pm and the wind changed to the south-west. The fire headed toward the town of Terang. The fire passed the town to its north and was brought under control the next day. In total nine people died, 50,000 hectares burnt, 157 houses destroyed and 19,300 livestock was lost.  Another person died near Branxholme from a smaller fire caused by power line fault.  2. East Trentham - Macedon fire complex. This fire began around 2.00 pm near East Trentham due to two powerlines touching and sparking. The fire moved to the Wombat State Forest and burnt much of Bullengarook. The fire stalled for a while but upon wind change to the south-west the fire picked up again and headed toward Woodend with a 7 m fire front at 8.30 pm. It reached Macedon where people and animals sheltered in the Hotel protected by volunteers. The rest of the town was annihilated. After reaching the top of Mount Macedon it was controlled in an area that was previously burnt on 1 February.

The fire moved to Aireys Inlet where the fibro houses were hit by walls of flame and a gigantic firestorm. The fire moved at extraordinary speed and next hit was Anglesea, where houses were lost but the main part of town was saved. The fire burnt on through the night toward Jan Juc and Torquay and was eventually contained early morning near Bellbrae. Three people were killed and 578 houses and other buildings were lost.  4. Upper Beaconsfield - Cockatoo complex. This fire began in Belgrave Heights south of Mount Dandenong. Half an hour later 10 km away, a fire started in Cockatoo and remained static until later that night. The first fire moved 15 km toward Berwick and Pakenham and firefighters were just beginning to gain control when the wind change came through at 8.30 pm redirecting the fire towards Upper Beaconsfield. Firefighters were caught in terrible circumstances leading to deaths. The Cockatoo fire began to flare at 7.30 pm. The fire went right through the town of Cockatoo as fire trucks had been called away to other fires. There were reports of women and children being sheltered and saved at a local kindergarten. The kindergarden building was later recorded by Heritage Victoria as a building of significance to be protected. In total, 27 people died, 100 were injured and 535 houses and buildings destroyed.  5.

Other significant fire fronts were located at Lake Repulse and Bicheno.  The Forcett fire was first reported in bushland outside the town heading towards Dunalley, on Thursday 3 January 2013 at approximately 2.00 pm. The fire escaped containment lines the following afternoon fanned by strong winds and burned towards the coast at several points. More than 100 properties were destroyed and 2500 hectares of land were burnt by the afternoon of 6 January. At least 80 properties were either damaged or destroyed in Dunalley and nearby Boomer Bay, approximately 20 houses were destroyed at Murdunna and 40 per cent of structures were lost at Connelly&rsquo;s Marsh. The fire threatened the town of Taranna and on 14 January 2013 a Victorian volunteer firefighter was killed when undertaking back burning operations in the vicinity. An estimated 24,000 hectares were burnt in the fire and at its peak the perimeter of the fire approximated 200 km.  Thousands of locals and tourists were stranded as a result of the Forcett bushfire which effectively cut the Tasman Peninsula off from the rest of the state. The peninsula's main access road, the Arthur Highway, was closed from 4 to 13 January. People converged on Port Arthur to await evacuation by sea or road and due to shortages of food and other supplies, the community arranged for a fleet of boats to make deliveries to those stranded on the peninsula. Two private catamaran operators in Hobart were asked by police to help evacuate people from the Nubeena jetty.  Evacuees were then taken to Hobart where they were met by relatives and friends or taken in by volunteers.  The Highway was partially opened on 11 January to allow stranded people and supplies to get through and was eventually opened to general traffic on 13 January.  Community refuges were established at the Sorrell Memorial Hall, Nubeena Community Centre, Bicheno Community Hall and Swansea Football Ground. There was also a Recovery Centre established at City Hall, Hobart.  The electricity company, Aurora, reported approximately 300 electricity poles were destroyed on the Tasman Peninsula, consequently power outages are expected to be an issue for a considerable time.  Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payments were made available to residents in the south-east and east of Tasmania, covering the affected local government areas of Sorell, Tasman and Glamorgan-Spring Bay. Other grants made available were immediate cash assistance grants, housing assistance grants, Aurora energy assistance and clean-up and assistance grants. A first stage recovery payment from the Red Cross Appeal Distribution Committee was distributed, providing $3000 per adult and $1000 per child by late January. The Department of Human Services has allocated over $7,845,000 to cover approximately 6900 claims.  The Insurance Council of Australia advised as at 1 February 2013 that 1783 insurance claims had been received with losses estimated at $86.7 million, about 85 per cent of these related to property, seven per cent for domestic vehicles, with the balance consisting of smaller claims for other losses.  The fire at Lake Repulse burnt more than 12,000 hectares and threatened the towns of Ellendale Ouse, Karanja, Westerway and Hamilton. Police allege it was started by an unattended campfire.
